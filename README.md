Based on the global rise of cases experiencing the skin cancer problem, the developments are
also rapidly moving forwards to be given the breaking solution with the help of advanced
AI model structures. As a part of the contribution towards the novel solution, this research
designs some objectives to conquer the challenges of increasing demand of diagnosing
techniques with the more accurate commitments. The objectives of this study are marked as
follows:
1. To investigate and synthesise existing research methods on skin cancer diagnosis with
the emphasis on AI applications and deep neural networks.
2. To analyse, design, and implement a robust methodology for skin cancer classification
into multiple skin lesion types compared with state-of-the-art techniques including
novel frameworks and preprocessing pipelines.
3. In order to solve the imbalance in the dataset, the research aims to study the possibility
of the classification performance being improved by the replication of minority lesion
class images by performing appropriate augmentation.
4. In order to conduct an in-depth analysis of the performance of each model, with a
particular focus on traditional measures like accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure,
the research aims to address prior research gaps and present novel solutions. The
solution is supposed to make a significant contribution to the field of dermatology and
artificial intelligence by providing essential insights.
